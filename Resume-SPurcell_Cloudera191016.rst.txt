    Key Competencies
    =======================

..
    Communication Skills: I have excellent written and verbal communication skills. For two years I taught classes of up to 30 students on a regular basis.  In my more recent training experiences I've taught smaller groups in more intensive, more highly technical topics. In my prior work history, I spent 12 years in Christian Ministry and spoke before congregations of up to 90 people two or three times weekly.  In a previous role at Dell, I developed revenue-generating courseware for Dell Professional Services.  In my secondary employment, I teach continuing education classes at Austin Community College in course for RHCE preparation and LPI preparation.  

..    
    Setting/Balancing Priorities: My present position is in a very fast-paced environment with multiple projects under way at all times. Managing multiple projects with differing deadlines is critical.

..
    Versatility: The culture at Dell values flexibility and a turn-on-a-dime nimbleness in response to new opportunities or marketplace demands.  I’ve become well adjusted to changing expectations or job requirements.  Picking up new skills to get the job done is a challenge I relish.
