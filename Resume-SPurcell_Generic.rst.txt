Summary of Job Experience
================================

    I worked from Feb 2015 through March 2017 as a Sr. Technical Instructor for AlienVault.  My responsibilities included curriculum development and classroom instruction on the deployment and usage of AlienVault USM solutions, as well as Incident Response and Security Analysis.  I continue to work with them on a contract basis as a training partner.
    
    I have worked since April of 2013 as a Cloud Technologies Instructor for Rackspace. My responsibilities included curriculum development and classroom instruction on Openstack (releases from Folsom to Juno) and on Hadoop. My students were chiefly external to Rackspace, although we did some internal training as well. Our lab environment made use of PXE servers, Chef, and Ansible for deployment.

    From 1997 to 2013 I worked as a Technical Trainer and Curriculum Developer at Dell.  In the latter years of that period, my primary area of focus was developing and delivering Linux and Unix-related training including preparatory courses for the LPI Linux Certifications and the Red Hat RHCE certification.  
    
    I developed courses on Linux Basics, Enterprise Linux on Dell PowerEdge Servers, an RHCE Prep course, a new product introduction course on SLES 11, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Platform with Clustering and GFS.  
    
    I have been system administrator of a virtualization infrastructure used to provide online Linux training to the Dell Technical Support call centers (globally) and I was part of the Infrastructure Support Team responsible for maintaining the datacenter we used for the development and delivery of our training globally.
    
    For two years I was one of the primary developers of the courseware and exams used in Dell’s DCEE/DCP Certification program (developed in partnership with Galton Technologies (later, Thompson Prometric). 


Publications
==================

In January of 2012 I authored a Dell White Paper on the deployment of a training infrastructure for cloud-computing solutions. It is linked at:

    Key Competencies
    =======================

..
    Communication Skills: I have excellent written and verbal communication skills. For two years I taught classes of up to 30 students on a regular basis.  In my more recent training experiences I've taught smaller groups in more intensive, more highly technical topics. In my prior work history, I spent 12 years in Christian Ministry and spoke before congregations of up to 90 people two or three times weekly.  In a previous role at Dell, I developed revenue-generating courseware for Dell Professional Services.  In my secondary employment, I teach continuing education classes at Austin Community College in course for RHCE preparation and LPI preparation.  

..    
    Setting/Balancing Priorities: My present position is in a very fast-paced environment with multiple projects under way at all times. Managing multiple projects with differing deadlines is critical.

..
    Versatility: The culture at Dell values flexibility and a turn-on-a-dime nimbleness in response to new opportunities or marketplace demands.  I’ve become well adjusted to changing expectations or job requirements.  Picking up new skills to get the job done is a challenge I relish.
